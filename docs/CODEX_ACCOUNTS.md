# Codex: multiple accounts and renewal dates

Allowance Bar can monitor several ChatGPT/Codex subscriptions side by side —
for example a personal account, a work account, and an older one — each with
its own meter, menu bar entry, and (optionally) a tracked billing renewal
date. This guide explains how it works and how to set it up.

## How Allowance Bar reads Codex usage

Since 1.11.0, Allowance Bar gets Codex numbers from your own Codex CLI rather
than from session logs alone. Every five minutes per account it launches
`codex app-server` for about a second, asks two questions over Codex's
documented JSON-RPC protocol (`account/read` for the signed-in email and plan,
`account/rateLimits/read` for the limit windows), and quits the process.

What this means for trust:

- **Allowance Bar never touches your tokens.** Codex reads its own credentials,
  refreshes them, and talks to OpenAI. Allowance Bar only sees the answer.
- **Allowance Bar never signs you in.** You run `codex login` yourself, in
  Terminal, for each account.
- **No background processes.** The helper runs for roughly a second and exits.
- **Offline fallback.** For the default account, the newest session log is
  still parsed when the app-server is unavailable, and it keeps updates
  instant while you are actively using the CLI.

Requirements: the Codex CLI installed (Homebrew, npm, or the ChatGPT desktop
app's bundled binary works if it is on your PATH or in `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
`/usr/local/bin`, or `~/.local/bin`).

## Adding another account

Codex keeps everything for one login in a *home* directory — `~/.codex` by
default. A second account simply gets a second home. Codex refuses to start
when the home does not exist yet, so create it first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex-work && CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login
```

A browser opens. **Sign in to the account you want in that home.** chatgpt.com
will happily reuse whichever account is already signed in, so sign out first
or paste the login URL into a private window if you are adding several
accounts in a row.

Then open **Allowance Bar → Settings → Providers → Codex accounts**. Any
`~/.codex-*` folder that contains a login appears as
"Found signed-in Codex home: work" with an **Add** button. Click it. The
account shows "Loading…" and, within a few seconds, resolves to its email
and plan.

You can also click **Add account…** to enter a label and any home path by
hand; the form shows the exact Terminal command (with `mkdir -p`) and a
**Copy login command** button.

To verify which account landed where:

```bash
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login status
codex login status              # your default login, unchanged
```

**Removing** an account in Settings only forgets the path — it does not sign
out. To sign out, run `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex logout`, or delete the
folder.

## How accounts appear

| Where | Default account (`~/.codex`) | Extra account labeled `work` |
|-------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Dropdown section | "Codex" + plan capsule | "Codex — work" + plan capsule + email caption |
| Menu bar | `Cx 12%` | `CxW 40%` (first letter of the label) |
| Snapshot / CLI id | `codex` | `codex:<uuid>` with `accountEmail` and `planType` |

Each account is a separate provider: it has its own visibility setting
(Auto/On/Off), its own menu bar toggle, and its own threshold notifications.

If your default `~/.codex` login is the same account as one of your extra
homes, set the duplicate to **Off** in Settings → Providers.

## Tracking subscription renewal dates

OpenAI does not publish consumer subscription renewal dates through any API,
so Allowance Bar lets you record them and keeps them clearly separate from usage
windows. A renewal is about billing; a usage window is about rate limits. The
two never share a meter.

In **Settings → Providers → Codex accounts**, expand **Subscription** under any
account and turn on **Track renewal date**:

- **Renews on** — the date from your billing platform.
- **Billed through** — ChatGPT, Apple, Google Play, or Other. Check the platform
  that actually charges you: for App Store or Play subscriptions the date on
  chatgpt.com may not match.
- **Remind me** — Off, or 1 / 3 / 7 days before. Reminders use macOS
  notifications and respect the global notifications toggle; you get one per
  renewal cycle.
- **I confirmed this date today** — marks the date as verified. After 90 days
  without confirmation the dropdown shows "(expected)" instead of
  "(confirmed)" as a nudge to re-check.

The dropdown shows a calendar row such as "Renews Oct 3 · Apple (confirmed)".
Monthly renewals are computed on the anniversary day with correct month-end
clamping (a Jan 31 anchor renews Feb 28/29, then Mar 31).

Renewal data is stored in Allowance Bar's preferences and exposed to agents via
the snapshot's `renewal` field (see [AGENT_INTERFACE.md](AGENT_INTERFACE.md)).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| `Error loading configuration: CODEX_HOME points to … does not exist` | Create the folder first: `mkdir -p <home>`. |
| Account shows "Not signed in" | The home has no `auth.json`. Run the login command for that home. |
| Account shows "Codex CLI not found" | Allowance Bar could not find `codex`. Install it via Homebrew or make sure it is in `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, or your login shell's PATH. |
| Numbers seem stale | Live polling happens every 5 minutes. Open the dropdown and press Refresh, or run `allowancebar refresh --wait 15`. |
| Two sections show the same email | Your default `~/.codex` and an extra home are the same account. Turn one Off in Settings → Providers. |
| Nothing found under "Codex accounts" after logging in | Discovery only lists folders named `~/.codex-*` that contain `auth.json`. For other locations use **Add account…** and enter the path. |
